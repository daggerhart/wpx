# WPX Container & Service Locator

The WPX dependency injection container is available to plugins and themes as a way manage custom and reusable services.

## Getting the container and services

The container is available as a singleton for use at entry points into custom code.

```php
<?php

$container = \WPX::container();
```

The container can be checked for a service with the `has()` method, and can retrieve a service with the `get()` method.

```php
<?php

$container = \WPX::container();
if ($container->has('database') {
	$database = $container->get('database');
}
```

## Registering services in the container

To register new services within the container, we must define a specific file in our custom plugin.

Do this by creating a PHP file named `wpx.services.php` within your plugin or theme's folder.

This file follows the conventions of [PHP-DI](https://php-di.org/doc/php-definitions.html#syntax) project.

```php
<?php

use Example\Mailer;
use Example\MessageFormatterHtml;
use Wpx\DependencyInjection\ContainerInterface;
use function DI\create;

return [
  // Constructor resolution.
  'message_formatter' => create(MessageFormatterHtml::class),

  // Callable resolution.
  'mailer' => function (ContainerInterface $container) {
    return new Mailer(
      // Inject another service into this mailer service's constructor.
      $container->get('message_formatter')
    );
  },
];
```

Once the container has been built (The first time `\Wpx::container()` is run) we cannot add new services to it.

## Service Locator

The `Wpx` object contains a method for getting a single service by name: `\Wpx::service($name)`.

```php
<?php

$mailer = \Wpx::service('mailer');
$mailer->send(
  'jonathan@localhost',
  'Test email!',
  'Example of a theoretical email-sending service.'
);
```

> Generally. use of the Service Locator is discouraged, as it couples your custom code to the service locator rather than the true dependency (in this example, the `Mailer` service).

Instead of use the service locator, try to organize your plugin so that it can inject the dependencies that are needed by the system.
